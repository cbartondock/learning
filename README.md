# JDoe Tools and Experiments

In the Learning Directory I follow Traversy's excellent tutorials on React.js and React Native. We might want to consider investing in his React Native course on Eduonix (it's ~$35).

Full documentation for React.js can be found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and documentation for React Native can be found [here](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). I'm also going to be working on familiarizing myself with graphQL and refamiliarizing myself with the Node.js library.
